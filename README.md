soundwave is a voice-controlled endless runner where you wade the surfer through treacherous waves with the power of your voice!

## Instructions
- Control the surfer with your voice, and avoid the dolphins coming at you!
- Survive as long as possible, your score and speed is on the top right labelled "DST" for distance, and "SPD" for speed.
- The volume of your voice determines how high the surfer goes.
- The longer you maintain your voice, the faster the surfer moves.
- Doing a short shout will make the surfer do a flip that exterminates the dolphins.
- Enjoy a ｎｉｃｅ ｓｕｒｆｉｎｇ ｅｘｐｅｒｉｅｎｃｅ．
